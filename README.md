# SUPERSTORE

**Introduction**

Your code is a well-structured data processing pipeline that ingests, transforms, and aggregates data from a CSV file stored in Google Cloud Storage (GCS) into Google BigQuery. It follows the Bronze-Silver-Gold architecture, which is a common pattern in data engineering for managing data quality and transformation. Below is a detailed explanation of the code and suggestions for improvement.

**Code Overview**
process_dataset Function:

Triggered by a change in a GCS bucket (e.g., when a new file is uploaded).

Processes a CSV file (Cleaned_Superstore_Sales.csv) and loads it into BigQuery.

Follows the Bronze-Silver-Gold architecture:

**Bronze Layer:** Raw data is loaded into BigQuery.

**Silver Layer:** Data is cleaned and transformed (e.g., removing duplicates and null values).

**Gold Layer:** Data is aggregated (e.g., total sales by category).

## Steps:

Load raw data from GCS into the Bronze Layer.

Query data from the Bronze Layer and clean it for the Silver Layer.

Aggregate data for the Gold Layer.

Save the processed data into BigQuery tables.
This project analyzes sales and profitability data to identify the top 10 performing products. The visualization is created using Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool, to provide insights that can guide product and sales strategies.

**Objective**


To identify the Top 10 Products by Sales while also highlighting their profitability using a visualization. This project helps stakeholders understand which products generate the highest revenue and profit.

**Dataset Description**


The dataset used for this analysis is the Sample Superstore Sales dataset. It contains fictional sales data for a retail company. Key variables include:

Product Name: Name of the product sold.
Sales: Revenue generated by the product.
Profit: Profit earned on the product.
Other fields like Category, Sub-Category, and Region were not used in this visualization but are part of the dataset.

**Insights from the Visualization**


The chart highlights the top 10 products contributing the most to sales.
By hovering over the bars, profit details can be explored, revealing which products are not only generating high revenue but also significant profits.
This visualization provides actionable insights into which products drive business success.

**Project Outcome**


This Tableau project demonstrates how to effectively use data visualization to analyze sales performance. It identifies top-performing products and integrates profitability insights for better decision-making.

**Conclusion**


This project showcases the power of Tableau in simplifying complex data to drive actionable insights. The visualization is an excellent tool for business stakeholders to understand top-performing products, both in terms of revenue and profitability.
